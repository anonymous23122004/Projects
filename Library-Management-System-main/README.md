# Library-Management-System
Library Management System is specially designed for purpose of adding book’s records in a library. The system elaborates the basic concept for storing and generating the book’s detail. Here in this system, staff can sign up as a system admin. He/she can have full access to the system for maintaining daily records. The whole project is designed in ‘C’ language, different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. It’s easy to operate and understand by users. This is a simple mini project in C, built as a console application without using graphics features. It’s just a demonstration of the use of file handling in C language. This project is totally complete and is error-free.

# Features :

- Log-In System.
- Password Protected.
- Functions such as Add books, Search books, Issue books, delete the record of books issued, view record of books issued are added here.
- gotoxy() : In my Library Management System, I have used gotoxy() to align the text neatly—for menus, headings, input prompts, and output
  formatting. It gives the user a better visual experience and avoids messy output scrolling down the console.
